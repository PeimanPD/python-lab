# Python-Lab | Speech AI Skill Roadmap

**Author:** Peiman Pishyar-Dehkordi  
**Purpose:** Exercises and projects for transitioning from linguistics and speech science to AI and data science.  

---

## Day 1 — Environment Setup and First Notebook
**Goals**
- Install and verify Python 3.12 + Jupyter + Git.  
- Create first Jupyter notebook and plot a vowel space.

**Completed Tasks**
- ✅ Configured `speechlab` virtual environment.  
- ✅ Installed core libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.  
- ✅ Created and ran `day1_intro.ipynb`.  
- ✅ Produced `figures/day1_vowelspace.png`.  
- ✅ Linked local repo to GitHub.

**Key Learnings**
- Virtual environments ensure clean dependency management.  
- Git commits make your work traceable and safe.  
- Python visualisation can replicate Praat formant plots with custom styling.
